Alina had always loved the smell of rain. As a child growing up in Rivenfell, where the rains were as constant as night and day, as growth and death, she took a special sort of comfort in the rain. Callahan had no such constancy. The northern state had no seasons by which to mark the time, no earthly rhythms to teach children patience and adults hope. There were only the capricious whims of the climate. Alina found that she loved Callahan even more. When her father travelled north from Rivenfell to Callahan it took him three weeks and for those three weeks Alina would turn into the most sour little girl her small town had ever seen. See, Callahan was southeast of Stonebrooke, the little trading town where Alina’s mother had grown up. Whenever Alina convinced her father to let her make the journey up to Callahan, they would also travel from Callahan to Stonebrooke in one day, mostly because Alina was enraptured by the arid desert that separated the two.
Kieran had grown up his entire life in Callahan, frequently making the journey to Stonebrooke. Stonebrooke is north of Callahan. Rivenfell is south of Callahan.
