                    This project presents Story Mapper, a procedural tool that automatically generates fictional world maps directly from narrative prose using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and constraint satisfaction. Fantasy writers often describe spatial relationships implicitly through references to movement, direction, and travel time, but converting these descriptions into coherent maps is typically a time-consuming, manual process. Story Mapper integrates map generation into the writing environment itself through a Google Docs plug-in, allowing authors to visualize their worlds as they create them on the page.
The system extracts spatial information from user-selected text using named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and relation extraction. Travel durations are converted into approximate distances, enabling both qualitative cues (e.g., north of) and quantitative cues (e.g., 30 days on foot) to be expressed as spatial constraints. Contradictions, such as impossible directions or conflicting distances, are stored. The non-contradictory constraints form a Constraint Satisfaction Problem in which each location is represented as a variable with unknown coordinates. A solver implemented in Python computes a spatial layout that satisfies the maximum number of constraints.
A visualization module then renders the resulting layout as a terrain-style map using procedural generation techniques and displays it within the Google Doc. Conflicts are highlighted both on the map and in the text, offering immediate, actionable feedback without interrupting the writing process.
Overall, Story Mapper demonstrates how narrative language can be translated into structured spatial representations. It provides a practical authoring aid for maintaining world coherence and contributes to broader research on computational creativity by showing how AI-driven tools can augment, rather than replace, human storytelling.
